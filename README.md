🧬 Blood Cells Classification with Bounding Boxes
This project implements a deep learning-based object detection and localization model using TensorFlow and Keras to identify and classify blood cells in medical images. Unlike traditional object detection frameworks like YOLO, this custom model is lightweight, fast, and tailored for medical imaging tasks—achieving low-latency inference of just 2.33 milliseconds. It serves as an end-to-end solution, from preprocessing and training to evaluation and visualization, offering both classification and precise bounding box localization of blood cells.
